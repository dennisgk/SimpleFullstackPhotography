# SimpleFullstackPhotography

## What is this project?

This is a very simple template for a photography website. It does not require any user authentication, but it includes admin
accounts and a nice admin panel designed for easily uploading pictures to be automatically resized on the server. The images
in the example are from Lorem Picsum, and they are just place holders.

## What does this project use?

The Simply Fullstack Photography consists of a frontend, React website, and a backend, express website. The two components
mostly use GraphQL to communicate, but they also use other, static CRUD features. Both the frontend and backend 
are written in typescript to avoid confusion. The backend uses mariadb as its database and stores the photos as static
files in the sfp_images directory which the backend can access.
